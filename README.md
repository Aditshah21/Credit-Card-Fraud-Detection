# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
A data science project to check if a transaction is fraud or not from credit cards details

This challenge is a Kaggle compitetion problem. I had taken problem idea and the dataset from Kaggle. You can download the dataset from this link https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud. I have applied Random Forest Classifier to solve this problem and it's very imbalanced dataset. Any help would be appreciated for improving the accuracy of the model. Cheers to Data Science.
